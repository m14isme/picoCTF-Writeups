## Question

'Suspicious' is written all over this disk image.
Download [suspicious.dd.sda1]()

## Hint

- Hint 1: It may help to analyze this image in multiple ways: as a blob, and as an actual mounted disk.
- Hint 2: Have you heard of slack space? There is a certain set of tools that now come with Ubuntu that I'd recommend for examining that disk space phenomenon...

## Solution

In this challenge I had to understand some my new knowledge about [slack space](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/slack-space-file-slack-space). After searching for foresic tools, I found a tool is called [Autopsy](https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy).
