## Question

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594

## Hint

Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?

## Solution

After login, I've checked the source code but nothing to get.

We decided to check cookie of this website using [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en-US) extension on Google Chrome.I'll see a username: admin with value: False.

![EditThisCookie](https://github.com/m14ghost/PicoCTF-2019-Writeup/blob/master/Web%20Exploitation/Editthiscookie.png)

Try to change value to True the I've got the flag

## Flag
