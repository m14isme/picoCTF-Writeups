## Question

There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/53751/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:53751

## Hint

The password is being filtered.

## Solution

This is the same with `Irish Name Repo 1`, so I've tried the same bypass `' OR 1 --` but It did not work. => SQLi detected.

The hint is shown that only the password was filtered without username, then I've tried `admin';--` and It's worked.
