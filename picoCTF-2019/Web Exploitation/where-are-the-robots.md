## Hint

What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution

From hints, we'll search some information about robots.txt file. We can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard). Then we link to url: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47235/robots.txt, we will see something like below

```bash
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html
```
