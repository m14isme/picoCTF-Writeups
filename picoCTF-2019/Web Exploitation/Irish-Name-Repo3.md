## Question

There is a secure website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/40742/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/40742/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:40742. Try to see if you can login as admin!

## Hint

Seems like the password is encrypted.

## Solution

The challenge was given me a password input. I've tried a basic bypass `' OR 1=1'` but It did not work. But the hint is shown that `the password is encrypted` so the first thing I had to to is finding the encrytion method of the website.

After a while, I knew that the website using [ROT13](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ROT13) to encryption the string so I need to encode my bypass to login. Using [this](https://rot13.com/) tool to encode `' OR 1=1'` then I got `' BE 1=1'`. I've tried this and It's worked.
