## Question

This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag! https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:50522

## Hint

You don't need to download a new web browser

## Solution

Visting the website, It was given a Flag button, after clicked on it then an error was appeared `You're not picobrowser! Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.183 Safari/537.36 Edg/86.0.622.63`.

It seems like I need to access the website using picobrower but what is it?. I remembered to `User-Agent` in the browser. Basically, **_The User-Agent request header is a characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent._**. From that, somehow I have to change `User-Agent` to `picobrower` to get the flag.

I've used `curl` command to get the source code. In the first try, `curl -s "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/flag"`, I got nothing, but I saw something `You&#39;re not picobrowser! curl/7.68.0`, It shown me that I was using `cur;/7.68.0` so, I had to change this to `picobrowser`. I've changed my command like this `curl -s "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/flag" -H "User-Agent: picobrower"` => I had a source code that shown me the flag.

```bash
curl -s "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50522/flag" -H "User-Agent: picobrowser" | grep -oE "picoCTF{.*?}"
```

## Flag

`picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_51414fa7}`
