## Question

This secure website allows users to access the flag only if they are admin and if the time is exactly 1400. https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/25189/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/25189/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:25189

## Hint

Can cookies help you to get the flag?

## Solution

The website was given a Flag Button, after clicked on it, I saw something like this `I'm sorry it doesn't look like you are the admin or it's the incorrect time.` And looking at the hint, maybe I have to do something with cookie.

Open the console in Developer Tool, then set cookie info like this.

```js
document.cookie = "admin=True";
document.cookie = "time=1400";
```

Finally, click on flag button, I've got the flag

## Flag

`picoCTF{0p3n_t0_adm1n5_fa4905c1}`
